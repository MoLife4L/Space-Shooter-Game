Visual Feedback: The game provides visual indicators for spaceship health and displays the winner at the end of the game.
Dynamic Background: A visually appealing space-themed background creates an immersive atmosphere.

Technologies Used

The game is developed using the following technologies:

Python: The game is written in Python, showcasing my proficiency in the language.
Pygame: Pygame, a popular Python library for game development, is used to handle graphics, input events, sound, and more.
Image and Sound Files: The game incorporates image files for spaceships and the background, as well as sound files for sound effects, to enhance the visual and auditory experience.
